A functional library for Dart inspired by Haskell

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Vizidrix/dfunct/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Vizidrix/dfunct/latest)

Goals:
- Provide foundational abstractions (Monad, Maybe, ST, etc)
- Adhere to principles of strong typing wherever possible
- Address syntax barriers where possible (currying, patterns, etc)
- Learn by doing (imperitive backgorund moving to functional)
- Provide concrete usage examples in the form of Unit Tests
