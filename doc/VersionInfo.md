* 0.0.3 *
- Refactored Maybe monad
- Was able to remove all references to 'new' while preserving (improving?) the implementation
- - In hindsight I'd already swtiched to the func style toward the end of the unit test but it took a night of sleep to connect the dots

* 0.0.2 *
- Bumped version to fix some typos and info on dart pub page
 
* 0.0.1 *
- Initial release with Maybe monad implemented but little else
